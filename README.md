## General info

This is an academic project for "Good Programming Practices" classes. <br>
The "Home Organizer Web Application" project aims to develop a user-friendly web application that helps individuals and families manage and organize their household tasks, events, and personal information efficiently. <br>
The project will be implemented using C# and Blazor, with a strong focus on good programming practices. <br>

## Examples of key good programming practices to implement

* Modular Architecture: Use a modular architecture to separate different components and functionalities, promoting code reusability
* Consistent Coding Standards: Establish and adhere to consistent coding standards to ensure a uniform codebase that is easy to read and understand.
* Version Control and Collaboration: Utilize version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage source code, enabling collaboration and providing a history of changes.
* Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and logging to capture and track application errors for troubleshooting and debugging.
* User Experience (UX) and Responsive Design: Focus on creating a user-friendly interface with responsive design to provide an optimal user experience on various devices.
* Scalability: Design the application with scalability in mind to accommodate potential growth in user base and data.
* User Feedback and Iteration: Gather user feedback and iterate on the application to continuously improve its features and usability.
* Database Design: Design a well-structured and normalized database schema to store data efficiently. Implement database migrations for easy updates.
